    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Aspireing Game Developer since 2021 I focus on working gameplay systems, coding since 2015. <br>
        As a Gameplay Systems Programmer, I try and make my systems modular and desiner friendly allowing <br>
        for well crafted gameplay loops that are tailor made. I focus on trying to make a fun and strong<br>
        gameplay loop that lets people build off of them by adding depth to them.This lets the team have<br>
        aclear vision of what the gameplay should feel like early on and help get people on board.</p>
