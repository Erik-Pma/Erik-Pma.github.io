        <p id = "push" >
            I am Aspireing Game Developer since 2021 I focus on working gameplay systems, coding since 2015. 
            As a Gameplay Systems Programmer, I try and make my systems modular and desiner friendly allowing 
            for well crafted gameplay loops that are tailor made. I focus on trying to make a fun and strong
            gameplay loop that lets people build off of them by adding depth to them.This lets the team have
            aclear vision of what the gameplay should feel like early on and help get people on board.
